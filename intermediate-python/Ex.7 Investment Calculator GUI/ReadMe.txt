Features:

This Python GUI program focuses on the tkinter module & syntax to build a GUI,
while reinforcing key concepts such as if __name__ == "__main__". This statement becomes activated if this script is run individually and not imported as a module, which then activates two other statements -- the InvestmentCalculator class becomes initialized with the init constructor to the app variable, and then secondly the run method on the new app object is activated to trigger mainloop to listen for user actions.

Usage: 

To run this program, simply enter the initial amount of money, amount of time in years (without decimals), and finally the interest rate of your choosing. Then, click the compute button to display the data table.


Example:

Initial amount: 50000
Years: 5
Interest rate %: 6.25
