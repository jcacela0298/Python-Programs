This program focuses on the concepts of Object Oriented programming with classes and methods, inheritance, polymorphism with overriding, docstrings, import statements, getters, setters, and constructors.

The person.py file contains blueprints to create a person object, and company.py inherits everything from person.py and extends it by providing blueprints to create a customer person and an employee person. It includes new features specific to each type of person, including the new instance variables of badge number, salary, and credit score, along with their respective getters, setters, and constructors.

To Run this program, simply run the test_company.py file, which gathers information from each file and verifies that employees and customers can be created.
