# Python Celestial Guide Program
I built a constellation identifier program that returns information from another file depending on the user's inputted birthday.

To use this program, save both the Celestial_guide.py file and the CPHelper.py file into the same folder. If you want to use the command prompt, navigate to the appropriate directory and, after running the Python Celestial_Guide.py file, input values such as "yes," "february," and then "14."

During this project, I learned many key differences between Java and Python. For example, in Python, I didn't have to use the scanner functionality to accept user input. I did, however, have to be more careful with my indentation and understand that the hash marks represent comments, whereas in Java, comments are represented by slashes. Python also uses elif for "else-if" statements, and there are differences in the use of brackets, parentheses, semicolons, colons, and declaring functions.
