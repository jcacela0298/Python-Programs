For Python, I am most proud of my most recent Bank Account Management project. This program features the advanced topics of the Python class / object paradigm including importable dependencies, instance variables, class variables, getters, setters, __str__, __init__, docstrings, module naming conventions, using a test file, and pickling. I employ all of my code organization & readability techniques that I have learned in Python along the way:
